TODO if we record how the agent performs we can use emojis

ðŸ¡² Wide-Headed Rightwards Medium Barb Arrow
ðŸ¡° Wide-Headed Leftwards Medium Barb Arrow
ðŸ¡³ Wide-Headed Downwards Medium Barb Arrow
â†¶ anticlockwise top semicircle arrow symbol
â†·     clockwise top semicircle arrow symbol
âŸ± downwards quadruple arrow
â˜° Trigram for heaven

So for example if we record:
LðŸ¡°ðŸ¡°â†¶âŸ±2â˜°
It means that we had an L-shape tetromino, we moved it twice to the left, rotate 90deg counterclockwise,
drop it and we made 2 lines
